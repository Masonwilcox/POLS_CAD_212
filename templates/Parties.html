<div class="header-container">Political parties are far more than a simplistic mechanism for Canadians to decide which candidates to support. They are the driving forces that can transform the ideas of their constituents into reality, acting as crucial intermediaries in bringing those ideas to fruition.</div>

        <div class="sub-heading">So what is a political party?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="response">A political party can be defined as an organized group that nominates candidates and contests elections in order to influence the personnel and policy of the government. Parties are distinct from other groups in society in two main ways. “First, whereas interest groups generally possess a fairly narrow focus and articulate a single interest, political parties are usually broader in scope... Second, while other groups provide 'functional' representation — economic, occupational, cultural, religious, etc. — political parties are closely tied to the formal institution of government.”(Party System, ch. 14, p. 308) Generally speaking, a political party in Canada is a group of people who work together in pursuit of common goals and ideologies. These parties nominate and then support candidates who run for office, believing these individuals will, to the best of their ability, represent the needs and ideologies of the collective party. Moreover, once their representative is elected into office, or is forming part of the opposition, the political party and its members continue to support their chosen representatives while also holding them accountable to the party's values.

        <div class="response">Why are political parties important?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="sub-heading">In today's world, as discussed in the lecture and readings, people are now less inclined to be part of a political party. Consequently, this has led to substantial frustration come voting day, as people feel they are left voting for the candidate who will cause the least harm. This frustration could be alleviated if the majority of Canadians participated in leadership elections, which arguably are more important than any municipal, provincial, or federal election, as this is where individual voices matter the most. This has been clearly seen with parties now being predominantly composed of Baby Boomers and older, and political choices being made to reflect that demographic.</div>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="sub-heading">What is the reality of Candian political parties?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="response">Well, there are "two simple groups: the two major parties, and then all the others. The major parties, the Liberals and the Conservatives are the only parties ever to have formed a national government." (Brokerage System, ch. 24, p. 160) Moreover, the first-past-the-post system used in Canada, which is a contentious topic, has created a unique divide among the Canadian people. Often, the Conservatives will gain the most votes in any given election. Hence, there is often an argument made by Conservative members that they truly represent the majority of Canadians. However, because the first-past-the-post system allows the Liberal Party to win with fewer total votes but more seats, individuals are able to vote for the NDP or Green Party. Even though this does allow for better representation of individual ideologies, an argument can be made that by not giving the Liberals full control, they are forced to consider more conservative views. Conversely, it also leads to a coalition government between the Liberals and often the NDP, which can be argued as a beneficial outcome.</div>

        <div class="response">What has the impact of Political Parties in Canada been on Mason?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="sub-heading">In the readings, the discussion covers the brokerage system as well as ideological or class-based parties. Essentially, the argument is made that individuals believe parties either no longer or never truly represented the will of the people and their ideologies; instead, they have focused on catering to the wealthy. Consequently, I have developed little care and patience for the Canadian political system. The political parties that I have come to know as I have grown up, I would argue, are not driven by class nor by the ideals of their people. Instead, each party seems to splendidly fail while trying to do both, causing widespread frustration across the board. As I have mentioned before, I grew up splitting my life between two very different worlds, and the one thing they both have in common is their equal frustration and discouragement with the political parties of the 21st century. Hence, I spend little time on Canadian parties or parties from anywhere in the world. Instead, I choose to focus my efforts and time on doing as much direct help and change in institutions that I believe truly make a difference in Canadian society. One such example is my time spent at the Down Syndrome Research Foundation. I was there not only in support of my brother but also because it gave me a way to help in the community. Moreover, it is why I started a Highland Bagpipe and Drums band at my Cadet corps because the weekends when we could play at seniors' homes, or at a wedding, or a funeral, we could directly see all the joy and change we were bringing to individuals' lives. Therefore, Canadian political parties have impacted me to ignore them and to be more a part of my community.</div>
