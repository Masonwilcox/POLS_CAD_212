    <h2>Rural Perspectives in Canada: Navigating the Urban-Rural Divide</h2>
    <p>With only 19% of Canada's population living in rural settings as of 2011, it is clear that Canada is predominantly an urban nation, with 81% residing in urban areas (Urban-Rural, ch. 9, p. 184). This urban concentration has led to feelings of isolation and exploitation among those in rural regions, notably in the interior of British Columbia and northern Ontario, which perceive themselves as distant from and taken advantage of by their economic centers, Vancouver and Toronto, respectively (Urban-Rural, ch. 9, p. 185). This situation has resulted in 'rural alienation' within Canada, creating divisions within the country (Urban-Rural, ch. 9, p. 187). Significantly, this dynamic renders Canadian politics susceptible to foreign interference. Moreover, As the rural population dwindles and the rural workforce shrinks, Canada has been compelled to look abroad for the resources once produced domestically. This shift has heightened concerns about external influences on Canadian politics and economy, underscoring the need for policies that bridge the urban-rural divide and strengthen national sovereignty.

      <h2>Personal Reflections from Pemberton, B.C.</h2>
      <p>My time in Pemberton, B.C., has been eye-opening, providing me with firsthand experience in rural livingâ€”from operating a tractor and baling hay to riding horses and picking potatoes. This experience has not only deepened my appreciation for working the land and connecting with nature but also highlighted the contentious issues that often arise between urban and rural perspectives, especially regarding gun laws.</p>

    <h2>One Complex Exanmple of the Devied; Gun Laws</h2>
    <p>Although with Cadets especially Biatholn I did use several guns  I generally support stringent gun control and am inclined to question the necessity of firearms, my interactions in Pemberton have introduced me to the rural standpoint on hunting and gun ownership. In rural communities, hunting is not merely a sport but a sustainable way to procure food. Conversations with friends from the First Nations reserve in Pemberton revealed hunting as a practice steeped in respect and tradition, arguably one of the most honourable ways to engage with the natural world in the 21st century.</p>

    <h2>Bridging the Divide</h2>
    <p>These reflections underscore the complexity of the urban-rural divide and the importance of nuanced policies that respect both perspectives. Addressing rural alienation and its consequences for Canadian politics requires a balanced approach that values rural contributions and perspectives, ensuring that policies reflect the diverse needs and realities of all Canadians.</p>
